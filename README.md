# Joules: A Physics Study Tool

Joules is a simple, free and open source physics study tool that contains a list of  approximately 70 different problems typically seen in an introductory calculus-based college-level physics course that the user can choose from and print on the screen. Each problem is labeled/tagged, and the list is searchable, so if the user wants to find a specific problem, they can do so with ease. The user can also filter problems by chapter, so they will only get problems from the chapters they choose. If the user has solved a problem, they can mark it as "solved" which will take it out of rotation, meaning they won't be given that problem again for their current session.

Joules can be used as a study guide for your physics class, a test to see how much you know about concepts from an introductory physics course, or simply to brush up on your physics knowledge. Joules currently only includes content from a typical first-level physics course, but future updates will include content from the second-level course, electricity and magnetism.

# Why Joules?
Joules was made because I needed a way to store all the potential problems that will be on the final exam for my physics class. I needed a way to be able to choose which chapter I wanted to do a problem from without having to pull out 10+ problem set packets and find the problem by going though each packet sheet by sheet. This was just a big mess, so I figured that a program that did this for me would make me more efficient when studying for the final exam.

# Note
The problems provided in Joules are problems you would see in a final exam in a typical college-level physics course, therefore they are the most important problems from every chapter in a physics textbook. Also, note that the problems are chosen such that they do not involve a figure, since the program is purely text-based and meant to run in a console.
