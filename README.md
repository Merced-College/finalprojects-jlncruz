# Ikna: A flashcard creator for the command line
Ikna is a simple flashcard creator for the command line. Ikna lets you create flashcards with a front and back side, while also letting you study them like you would any flashcard set in real life. The program's goal is to showcase the power of HashMaps in Java while allowing the user to strengthen their knowledge on a subject through the power of active recall!

# Why Joules?
Ikna was made because I wanted to highlight the power of my favorite data structure we learned about in this course: HashMaps. A flashcard creator that lets you study the flashcards you create is the most intuitive implementation of HashMaps.
