# Joules: A Physics Study Tool

Joules is a simple, free and open source physics study tool that contains a list of  approximately 70 different problems typically seen in an introductory calculus-based college-level physics course that the user can choose from and print on the screen. Each problem is labeled/tagged, and the list is searchable, so if the user wants to find a specific problem, they can do so with ease. The user can also filter problems by chapter, so they will only get problems from the chapters they choose. If the user has solved a problem, they can mark it as "solved" which will take it out of rotation, meaning they won't be given that problem again for their current session.

Joules can be used as a study guide for your physics class, a test to see how much you know about concepts from an introductory physics course, or simply to brush up on your physics knowledge. Joules currently only includes content from a typical first-level physics course, but future updates will include content from the second-level course, electricity and magnetism.

# Why Joules?
Joules was made beacuse there is a lack of **accesssible** online study tools for physics. More specifically, a tool that allows you to solve problems from a book wherever you want, and whenever you want without having to spend your life savings on some old ripped-up textbook from the early 1900s, or overpriced software like Pearson, which sucks the money out of your wallet, and tears from your eyes. Joules makes the joy of studying physics and receiving instant feedback accessible to everyone, no matter what walk of life you come from.
