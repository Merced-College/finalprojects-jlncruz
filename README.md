# Joules: A Physics Study Tool

Joules is a physics study tool that contains a list of ~70 different problems typically seen in an introductory calculus-based college-level physics course that the user can choose from and print on the screen. Each problem is labeled/tagged, and the list is searchable, so if the user wants to find a specific problem, they can do so with ease. The user can also filter problems by chapter, so they will only get problems from the chapters they choose. If the user has solved a problem, they can mark it as "solved" which will take it out of rotation, meaning they won't be given that problem again for their current session. Joules can be used as a study guide for your physics class, a test to see how much you know about concepts from an introductory physics course, or simply to brush up on your physics knowledge. Joules currently only includes content from a typical first-level physics course, but future updates will include content from the second-level course, electricity and magnetism.
