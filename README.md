# Ikna: A flashcard creator for the command line
Ikna is a simple flashcard creator for the command line. Ikna lets you create flashcards with a front and back side, while also letting you study them like you would any flashcard set in real life. Ikna is just "Anki" backwards because this program is inspired by Anki. The program's goal is to showcase the power of HashMaps in Java while allowing the user to strengthen their knowledge on a subject through the power of active recall!

# Why a flashcard creator?
Ikna was made because I have utilized studying with flashcards through Anki, which is an amazing piece of software that I highly recommend. I have a lot of respect for the people that create really good software like Anki, and I wanted to give a shot at creating my own flashcard studying program to see how difficult it was. I also wanted to highlight the power of my favorite data structure we learned about in this course: HashMaps. A flashcard creator that stores the flashcards you create (front and back side), and lets you study the them after is the most intuitive implementation of HashMaps/HashTables. I had a lot of fun making this program and I plan on expanding on it more and more throughout the next couple months, so that I can use it regularly.

# Ikna's Time Complexity
Since Ikna utilizes HashMaps, and all the user does is store (insertion), retrieve (lookup), and delete (deletion) data from the HashMap, Ikna has a time complexity of O(1), which means the running time is constant, no matter the size of the input.
